# PocketDex
This application was built with the sole purpose of enhencing the game experience of die hard pokemon fans.
The main goal of the app is to allow a user to keep track of all the pokemon they have caught throughout the various games they played.
I created this app in the hope of it acting like a real Pokedex one which is not limited to the ingame incorporated one.
The application makes it a lot easier for each trainer to keep track of their pokemons and potentially achieve the ultimate goal of catching them all.
It also allows its users to bypass another restriction that some games have which is the availability of certain pokemons within the game.
