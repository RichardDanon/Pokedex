# PocketDex

##Description

This application was built with the sole purpose of enhencing the game experience of die hard pokemon fans.
The main goal of the app is to allow a user to keep track of all the pokemon they have caught throughout the various games they played.
I created this app in the hope of it acting like a real Pokedex one which is not limited to the ingame incorporated one.
The application makes it a lot easier for each trainer to keep track of their pokemons and potentially achieve the ultimate goal of catching them all.
It also allows its users to bypass another restriction that some games have which is the availability of certain pokemons within the game.
With the application you can view all your pokemons in the pokemon tab.
You can also view all the regions available and by clicking on them you can see the pokemons that you have caught withing that region.
You can add a new pokemon to the application and update and existing pokemon.
The application also allows the user to delete a pokemon they added.
